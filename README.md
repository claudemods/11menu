##
v1.02 25/03/2025 
after many hours of button mashing and speaking to deepseek ive fixed the signout and signout, shutdown, restart prompt üöÄ
please remove old version, install v1.02 and then reboot for fixes to take affect
no need for icu package anymore kde updated to  the new package but i will still provide the file

icu package breaks menu download and extract .tar.gz to /usr/lib or /lib to fix the menu 

forked from https://www.pling.me/p/2171750/ ADHE
i removed the recent documents section
you can change the size of the menu 
also the photo shown on menu isnt included thats my account picture
the default menu colour is your systems colours mine so happens to be blue

configure method
right click default application menu and select show alternatives
select menu 11 
##
to configure sizes location ect.........
simply right click application menu and select configure menu 11
options that are configurable are shown in my 3rd photo 

If you plan to change from menu 11
To my menu you need to signout
After installing For the menu to change to mine

known issues 
doesnt like to work in vms you need to change first option shown in 3rd photo
to any option and then back to your default e.g small this is only a bug in virtual machines


i may see what else i can change with this but for now all works fine and its how i want it
I will be add this into my plasma 6 distros
