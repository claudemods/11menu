you can change the size of the menu 
also the photo shown on menu isnt included thats my account picture
the default menu colour is your systems colours mine so happens to be blue

options that are configurable are shown in my 3rd photo 

If you plan to change from menu 11
To my menu you need to signout
After installing For the menu to change to mine
